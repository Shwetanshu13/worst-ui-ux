# 😈 Worst UI/UX Experience Ever

Welcome to the most frustrating, annoying, yet hilariously fun website you'll ever use! This project is a deliberate exercise in creating the **worst possible user experience** while maintaining full functionality.

## 🎭 What Makes This So Terrible?

This web application features three progressively infuriating pages designed to test your patience:

### 1. 🔐 Login Page

- **Disabled Keyboard**: Can't type normally? That's the point!
- **Random Virtual Keyboard**: A virtual keyboard that completely **randomizes its layout after every single keystroke**
- **Credentials**:
  - Username: `upvision`
  - Password: `nitelhi`
- Good luck finding those letters as they jump around the screen!

### 2. 🎈 Loading Page

- **Manual Pump Required**: No automatic loading bars here!
- **Interactive Balloon Pump**: Drag the pump handle up and down repeatedly to inflate a balloon from 0% to 100%
- **Inefficient by Design**: The pump has been calibrated to be gloriously inefficient - you'll need LOTS of pumping!
- Watch the balloon grow and change colors as you work for your progress

### 3. 📱 Phone Number Page

- **Starting Value**: The input begins at a whopping **1,000,000,000**
- **No Typing Allowed**: Use only the UP (▲) and DOWN (▼) buttons
- **One Click = One Number**: Want to enter a 10-digit phone number? Better start clicking!
- **Click Counter**: Tracks every painful click you make

## 🎉 Credits

Created as a hackathon project to explore the boundaries of what makes UI/UX truly terrible. Sometimes the best way to learn good design is to make something intentionally bad!

**Remember**: This is satire. Real applications should prioritize user experience, accessibility, and efficiency. But hey, it's fun to break the rules sometimes! 😈
